# NOTE: log timestamps do not move monotonically forward, but they don't
# seem to ever jump backwards more than 241 seconds. I assume this is
# some timeout that's set to 4 minutes, and the log entry shows up after
# expiry, or something. Anyway, what this means is that once we've seen
# a timestamp that's 241 seconds past the end of a week, we can assume that
# there will be no further entries whose timestamps belong to the previous
# week.
# We could probably watch the max jitter between log lines and adjust
# this if needed, but for now I'm just gonna pad it to 600 seconds.
# The difference between 241 and 600 is kind of irrelevant - since we get logs
# in 24-hour chunks, any window that extends into the next day means we have to
# wait 24 hours until we can be sure we have all the data for the previous
# week, so the effect would be the same if this was 3600 or 43200 or whatever.
